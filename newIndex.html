        <h3>Summer In Seattle</h3>
          Over the summer, I spent my vacation doing research at the Unviersity of Washington for the Computer Science department. This research opportunity was made possible through the DREU I was awarded. My mentor, Anat Caspi, had me working with on an inter-disciplinary, data-driven project that partnered with University of Washington's eScience Center's program called Data Science for Social Good. Our specific project aimed to improve efficiency for the paratransit program in King County. For more information, check out my <a href="http://emilydreu.weebly.com/">summer blog</a>.

  These scripts are written in JavaScript. You'll be breaking them down as part of
  a quiz. Essentially, the next few lines are checking to see if you have not

  of the resume, then that part of the resume does not show up. More on this in the
  course.
